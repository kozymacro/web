      <description>Kozy allows you to define your own customized macros. You can record key presses/mouse clicks and color conditions. Easy to use user interface let you define everything with few clicks. The custom macros work on every game!
 Basics There are two different custom macro button under the farm section and pk section.
Farm macros always start when the farm macro triggered. (Usually F11.)
PK macros can be controlled by using the key you have assigned.</description>

      <description>A macro can move your mouse automatically and can use your keyboard&amp;rsquo;s keys seamlessly.
There is an animation and cooldown time for the skills you can use on the Knight Online. Giving the best possible damage can be hard for you but not for macro.
Game hacks like koxps(not kozymacro) inject some malicius code to the games or touch the game files. This is not allowed. But macro softwares don&amp;rsquo;t interfere like that.</description>
