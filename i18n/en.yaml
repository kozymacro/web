faqRiseZBlockAnswer:
  other: |
    Nothing can be as good as clicking Z, but you can use the settings in the Mob click tab as an alternative.
faqRiseCaptchaQuestion:
  other: Is there a solution for Rise Online Captcha?
faqRiseCaptchaAnswer:
  other: |
    Yes, notifications can be sent when captcha appears, but it cannot be solved automatically.
faqMultiClientQuestion:
  other: Does it work for multi client?
faqMultiClientAnswer:
  other: |
    No, macro software can only run on the currently active screen.
faqWindowModeQuestion:
  other: Does it work in window mode?
faqWindowModeAnswer:
  other: Yes.
faqAutoLootQuestion:
  other: Is there auto loot?
faqAutoLootAnswer:
  other: |
    No, you can use pet for auto looting.
faqHpMpIssueQuestion:
  other: HP/MP is not working or working incorrectly. What should I do?
faqHpMpIssueAnswer:
  other: |
    Close the macro completely. Open it again. Fill your HP and MP. Without moving the HP and MP indicator, position it against a background without any blue or red tones. For example: don't let it be against the blue sky. Now start the macro.
    <ul>
    <li>Also, in some PVPs, HP value texts are very large. Setting a percentage that matches these can cause confusion. If you can reduce the text on HP/MP by changing the font, do so.</li>
    <li>If HP is being used when you're debuffed by Parasite etc., let mana or HP decrease once through normal means. After that, it won't unnecessarily use potions even if you get debuffed by parasite.</li>
    <li>If you're using it in a virtual PC, make sure to install vmware tools with graphics options selected. For Rise, see the Rise requirements section above.</li>
    </ul>
faqSmartHpMpQuestion:
  other: What is the Smart HP/MP feature?
faqSmartHpMpAnswer:
  other: |
    A feature that saves you from the trouble of using potions during PK and does this smartly without any delay. You can even do VS. Priests can focus on db or healing, while warriors, archers and mages can focus entirely on attacking. Put HP/MP in the last slots like 7-8 and use the first rows of the skill bar as you wish.
faqVideoModeQuestion:
  other: Can I watch videos while Kozymacro is running?
faqVideoModeAnswer:
  other: |
    For KO: Yes, absolutely. Just press Ctrl+F11 when the video is behind the game and the macro is running. Press Ctrl+F11 again to activate the game.<br/><br/>
    For Rise Online: Yes, you can even use the mouse and keyboard as you wish.
faqAfkNotificationQuestion:
  other: Can I know the party and HP/MP status when I'm AFK? Will I get notified if I can't select a mob?
faqAfkNotificationAnswer:
  other: |
    Discord and Telegram notifications! Kozymacro can send you discord or telegram notifications for that.
faqAutoKeysQuestion:
  other: Is there a way to automatically press desired keys at timed intervals?
faqAutoKeysAnswer:
  other: |
    Yes, you can use the automatic keys section. There's also a more advanced custom macro section. Details: <a href="https://kozymacro.com/en/videos/#general-custom-macro" target="_blank">Video</a>
faqSpecialLinkQuestion:
  other: What is the special download link?
faqSpecialLinkAnswer:
  other: |
    The latest Kozy version is compiled from scratch. An exe is created with a random exe name. This way, you use a different exe from others. This eliminates the possibility of being caught by exe name and having problems. It provides extra security. Risk is never zero.<br/><br/>
    <b>Will I get a new special download link when a new version is released?</b><br/>
    No, special download links are purchased only for the current latest version. You don't have to get it when a new version comes out. This is completely optional. Your special version will always work.
faqPartyHealQuestion:
  other: There are problems with party healing. How can I solve it?
faqPartyHealAnswer:
  other: |
    If you're farming in an icy or white area, enlarge the general chat window so it becomes the background of the party list.
faqSlotRestrictQuestion:
  other: How can I prevent it from going to adjacent slots? Is there area restriction?
faqSlotRestrictAnswer:
  other: |
    You can make it attack only the selected mob with mob selection in attack settings. If there's the same mob in the adjacent slot, it will still go. But if no one is farming in the adjacent slot, check "Wait HP" in attack settings. There is no area restriction.
faqServerOwnerQuestion:
  other: I'm a server/game owner. Should I ban everyone using Kozy?
faqServerOwnerAnswer:
  other: |
    Kozy aims to help players stay in the game, spend more time in the game, and have more fun. It absolutely doesn't add cheats to the game. What it can do is limited to game mechanics. Most importantly, it's reliable for everyone. Players prefer to use Kozy instead of using many different hacks and/or software that inevitably cause security problems. In today's world where there are macros even with mice, bans and restrictions direct players to more problematic ways, creating extra problems for games and players. Our wish is for everyone to use Kozy, the most reliable software within the macro framework, as much as they want, safely and knowingly.
faqUninstallQuestion:
  other: I want to completely remove Kozy from my computer. What should I do?

faqCloseGameWarningQuestion:
  other: I'm getting a "Close game" warning. What should I do?

faqValidationErrorQuestion:
  other: I'm getting a validation failed error when entering the game. What should I do?
faqValidationErrorAnswer:
  other: |
    Set your computer's time to automatic and make sure the time is exactly correct.
faqSecondaryModeLockedQuestion:
  other: My keyboard/mouse got locked when I activated secondary mode. What should I do?
faqSecondaryModeLockedAnswer:
  other: |
    Try unplugging and plugging in the keyboards. If that doesn't work, try plugging in a different keyboard. If no keyboard or mouse is plugged in, plug them in. If you can make a remote connection, do so and switch back to primary mode. If you can't, start the PC with a bootable USB and initiate a system restore to a trouble-free date.
faqSecondaryModeNotWorkingQuestion:
  other: I activated secondary keyboard/mouse mode but it's still not working. What should I do?
faqSecondaryModeNotWorkingAnswer:
  other: |
    Kozy->Settings->Reset->Click "Yes, Reset" in the warning message->Restart PC.<br/>
    Then set up secondary mode again and don't forget to restart PC. Keep keyboard and mouse plugged into the PC.
faqMacroNotWorkingQuestion:
  other: Macro is working incorrectly, not doing what I want. Why?
faqMacroNotWorkingAnswer:
  other: |
    Must-watch video: <a href="https://kozymacro.com/en/videos/#general-first-settings" target="_blank">Video</a>
    <ul>
    <li>Game and Windows resolutions must be the same.</li>
    <li>Windows scaling setting must be 100%.</li>
    <li>All windows, tabs and folders with Knight/Rise in their name must be closed.</li>
    <li>For USKO, secondary mode must be activated from Kozy settings. <a href="https://kozymacro.com/docs/img/change-input.png" target="_blank">Details</a></li>
    <li>If DirectX11, try DirectX9.</li>
    <li>For Rise, the Rise requirements section above must be completed fully.</li>
    <li>For potion issues, read the HP/MP question above.</li>
    </ul>
    If the problem persists, share full-screen images showing all your Kozy settings and the game settings we asked you to make through support channels, and explain your problem in detail.
faqTelegramNotificationQuestion:
  other: What should I do to receive notifications via Telegram? (version 2.5.8+)
faqTelegramNotificationAnswer:
  other: |
    <ol>
    <li>Type BotFather in Telegram's search. Click on the one with the blue check mark on the right.</li>
    <li>Start messaging with BotFather using the button at the bottom of the screen.</li>
    <li>An explanation message will come. Click on /newbot in the message.</li>
    <li>The message asks what our bot's name will be. This doesn't have to be unique. Choose a name and send it.</li>
    <li>Now it asks for username information. The important point is that the username must end with "bot" letters. You may not be able to create a bot on your first try because the username you thought of may already be taken.</li>
    <li>If you've successfully completed step 5, you now have a bot. The token given to you will enable communication with the bot. Note this token.</li>
    <li>Go to the search window again and type your bot's unique name exactly. Your bot will appear. Select it and start the conversation. Enter the conversation with the /start command.</li>
    <li>Enter the token you noted in the notifications window field in Kozy.</li>
    <li>If everything is fine, a Test message will be sent to you automatically.</li>
    </ol>
