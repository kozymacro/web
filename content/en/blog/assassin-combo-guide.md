## Why Should You Use Assassin Macro?

### 1. 🎯 Perfect Timing
In combo sequences you try to perform manually, achieving optimum damage is difficult due to skill animation times and cooldown periods. Assassin macro calculates these times perfectly and guarantees **highest DPS**.

### 2. ⚔️ PK Advantage
When facing other players during PK, being able to perform fast and effective combos is vital. With Kozy Macro's assassin combo, you'll be **one step ahead of your opponents**.

### 3. 🔄 Farm Without Fatigue
Continuously performing the same combos during long farming sessions causes hand fatigue and loss of concentration. With macro, you can **farm for hours without getting tired**.
