## Why Should You Use Minor Macro?

### 1. 🎯 Maximum Speed in Critical Moments
When your HP drops during PK, manually using minor might be too late. Minor macro increases your survival chances by casting minor **at maximum speed within server limits**.

### 2. 💊 MP Management
Minor macro continuously monitors your MP status. When your MP is insufficient, it doesn't cast minor unnecessarily, thus providing **MP savings**.

### 3. 🧠 Concentration Advantage
Constantly checking HP during challenging PK or farming distracts your attention. With minor macro, you can focus all your attention on attack and defense.
