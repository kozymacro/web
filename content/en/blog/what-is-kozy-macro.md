A macro can move your mouse automatically and can use your keyboard's keys seamlessly.

There is an animation and cooldown time for the skills you can use on the Knight Online. Giving the best possible damage can be hard for you but not for macro.

Game hacks inject some malicius code to the games or touch the game files. This is not allowed. But macro softwares don't interfere like that. Works like a mouse/keyboard. That is why most of the anti cheat systems not block you due to your macro. Macros are way safer than other software.

We believe that the macro software is only the game helpers at the end. So, not a cheat.

Kozy Macro is the best and well developed game helper. There are many content like videos, social media, discord and that site as well to effectively use it.
